          Full-stack engineer with 10+ years of experience building and scaling Ruby on Rails systems, with a focus on backend architecture, performance, and data-heavy products. First engineering hire at a VC-backed startup, where I owned core systems end to end, helped scale the engineering team, and set foundational practices around code quality, reviews, and delivery.

        <p>
          Previously worked as a software engineer at a Software Consultancy Company, partnering with national and international clients to ship production systems under tight timelines. Comfortable in remote, async-first environments and known for turning loosely defined product problems into reliable, maintainable software with clear business impact
